# AWS-MachineLearningAndVisualizing

#Machine Learning
1. Using Weka, Python libraries, or Java libraries, which contain k-means cluster
methods, try clustering your Map-Reduce output (using two dimensional data, or
only two of the dimensions) into clusters of 3, 7, 10, and 20.
Which give the best (most meaningful) result?


#Visualizing
1. Using D3.JS (or similar) packages
2. Import the output from the clustering above, and show scatter carts,
bar charts, bubble charts, with annotated color, through your web browser
on your screen.
